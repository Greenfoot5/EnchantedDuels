After the [Enchanted Discord Bot](https://top.gg/bot/697879596040716455) shut down, I tried to rework it in an afk dueling format. A day was spend on the code, and the art found online.

## How to play

1. Pick which items and spells to equip on your character. (Some Developer)
2. Watch as Some Developer fights against StEVIL the Rubber Duck! Will you succeed where others have failed?

# Installing, Compiling and Executing
1. Open Unity 2020.3.25f1 (Other versions may work, but this is what it was created in)
2. Either play in the editor, or build for your chosen platform
3. Run the program!
